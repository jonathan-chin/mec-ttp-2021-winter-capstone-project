# Phase 1

## Task
Please create a github repo for your group's capstone project. You'll be using the same repo for your capstone project for the rest of the bootcamp. For Phase 1, please create a `proposals.md` file with 3 ideas for what your team would like to build. For each idea, give:

- 1 sentence description of its purpose
- A list of high level, top down features that it would be able to do. don't worry about implementation / coding details

These projects should take data either from the user and/or a 3rd party and process it in some way. Here are some examples:

A stock tracker website that allows users to play-buy stocks and track their net value over time.  
A restaurant discovery website that allows users to enter their location and food preferences / restrictions and receive a list of restaurants that meet those criteria.
